# Relational System Z reasoner

This is a prototype implementation of an approach for default reasoning with first-order conditionals, similar to System Z by Judea Pearl. 

It was created as a part of the author's master thesis, which can be found in the top folder. The implemented approach was first published in the following paper:

G. Kern-Isberner and C. Beierle. A system Z-like approach for first-order default reasoning. In Thomas Eiter, Hannes Strass, Miroslaw Truszczynski, and Stefan Woltran, editors, Advances in Knowledge Representation, Logic Programming, and Abstract Argumentation - Essays Dedicated to Gerhard Brewka on the Occasion of His 60th Birthday, volume 9060 of LNAI, pages 81-95.
